Additional basis sets not present in the EMSL BSE database can be manually added in the db/nwchem directory as *.nwbas files or in db/g94 as *.gbs files. Each file should match a basis set name exactly, e.g. g3mp2large.nwbas for a basis set named "g3mp2large". These files can be converted to NWChem, GAMESS-US or Gaussian 94 (in the style of Psi4) basis formats automatically and on demand. A corresponding gamess-us directory has been created as a placeholder but at present there is no support for processing files formatted for GAMESS-US.
