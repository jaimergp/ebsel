Additional basis sets not present in the EMSL BSE database can be manually added in the db/nwchem directory as *.nwbas files. Each file should match a basis set name exactly, e.g. g3mp2large.nwbas for a basis set named "g3mp2large". These files can be converted to GAMESS-US and Gaussian 94 basis formats automatically and on demand. Corresponding gamess-us and g94 directories have been created as placeholders but at present there is no conversion functionality from those formats.
